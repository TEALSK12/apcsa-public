Procedure
---------
Students should complete the programming projects on their own. Read through the instructions with
the class, and help students pace themselves by setting progress goals for each day.

Before letting students begin the projects, ask students what resources are available to them so
they can help themselves before calling you over. (Notebooks, textbook, class handouts, student work
and posters hanging around the room, online resources.

### About Barron’s
- Barron’s is an AP CS A review book that some schools provide students. If your school doesn’t
  provide Barron’s there are many alternative homework assignments that can be found at
  codingbat.com/java or practice-it.

- Alternatively, you can save time spent on the lab by checking activities as homework.

- If you’ve chosen to introduce TextExcel earlier, you can assign portions of TextExcel as homework
  here to save time later in the course. TextExcel like FracCalc takes a lot of in and out of class
  time to complete, and time saved here saves time for AP test review.

### Programming Projects

On the overhead or shared electronically, provide students with the following programming prompts:

#### Programming Project I

Write an inheritance hierarchy of three-dimensional shapes:

1. Make a top-level shape interface that has methods for getting information such as the volume and
   surface area of a three-dimensional shape.

2. Then make classes and subclasses that implement various shapes such as cubes, rectangular
   prisms, spheres, triangular prisms, cones, and cylinders.

3. Place common behavior in superclasses whenever possible, and use abstract classes as appropriate.

4. Add methods to the subclasses to represent the unique behavior of each three-dimensional shape,
   such as a method to get a sphere’s radius.

#### Programming Project II - Applied Design Stages and Creating for End-Users

In this project your will interview an end-user in order to determine their interests. You will then write an inheritance hierarcy that stores data related to the end-user's interests.

1. Select an end-user (this can be a classmate, friend, teacher, relative, etc).
2. Create a series of questions that will allow you to understand their interests. Have the user respond to the questions and record their responses.
3. With the end-user, design a common superclass or interface that will store information related to their interests (ie: if the end-user is interested in sports then the superclass could include information common to any player regardless of sport, such as name, number, and salary).
4. With the end-user, design a subclasses for specific elements, characters or players that fall under the superclass structure (ie: players of your favorite sports, such as basketball, soccer or tennis could have specific attributes under the athlete superclass).
5. Place sport-specific information and behavior (such as kicking, vertical jump height, or speed) into subclasses whenever possible.
6. Program that superclass and subclasses. Your program should provide the user with a menu that allows them to display different data based on user's input.
7. Test the program with the end-user. Record their comments, suggestions and feedback and make any required changes.
8. Test the program with your classmates and friends. Record their comments, suggestions and feedback and make any required changes.
9. Submit to your teacher the interview questions and responses, the feedback from end-user testing, the feedback from classroom testing and the finished program.

## Grading Scheme/Rubric
|   |   |
| Implementation| Value   |
|---|---|
| Superclass is implemented effectively| 4 points|
| Subclasses are implemented effectively| 4 points|
| Superclass and Subclass are designed effectively considering user interests| 2 points|
| User and class testing is effective| 2 points|
| Menu and general flow of program is effective and user-friendly| 2 points|
| TOTAL | 14 points|
|---|---|
| Applied Design Steps|  Value|
| User interview questions and responses are thorough and informative| 1 point   |
| Ideating components are complete and thorough| 1 point   |
| Ideating/Prototyping are components complete and thorough| 1 point   |
| Testing components with user are complete and thorough| 1 point   |
| Testing components with class are complete and thorough| 1 point   |
| Total| 5 points  |
|---|---|
| Grand Total| 19 points |


Accommodation and Differentiation
---------------------------------
In some classrooms, you may want to provide the mathematical formulas for finding the volume of
spheres, triangular prisms, cones, and cylinders so students can focus on coding rather than finding
and translating the math. You can also introduce and reinforce useful vocabulary by providing
physical examples of these shapes. If you are having trouble finding prisms, cones, and cylinders,
you can make these items out of paper by printing out templates and following the instructions at
this website: ([**http://tinyurl.com/asz6e69**](http://tinyurl.com/asz6e69))

Remind students to always draw a structure diagram, sketch out their plan using pseudocode, and
include comments to remind themselves (and you!) of what each section of code is for.
