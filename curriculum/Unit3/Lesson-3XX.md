Lesson 3.XX — Programming Project (FracCalc Alternative)
====================================================================================================

## Overview
--------
### Objectives — _Students will be able to…_
- **Conduct user-centred research** to identify specific functions for a specialized calculator application
- **Plan and create** a calculator that perform specialized operations for an end-user
- **Test, evaluate, and share** the end product

---
#### Emphasize with students...

#### Content - arithmetic operations, data representation, applied design

The "brain" of the computer is a block of circuitry called the "Central Processing Unit" (CPU).  
Inside the CPU, there is a sub-block of circuitry called the "Arithmetic Logic Unit" (ALU).  As you might guess, this block performs arithmetic operations!

At a most basic level, the computer is simply, a "deluxe calculator".   While hand-held calculators have limitations on the size of numbers you can work with, your desktop or laptop computer can support much larger numbers.  Not only can the computer calculate numbers quickly, and accurately, it is also great at doing it over, and over, and over again.  The computer never gets bored. 

In what situations would you need to perform lots of calculations, possibly on very big, or very small, numbers?
How often do you still use, or when would you use, a hand-held calculator (or the calculator on your phone)?

### Assessments — _Students will…_
- **Apply** advanced data and control concepts covered in Unit 3
- **Submit** a complete, functional program 

### Pacing
- This project is intended to be the same length as the FracCalc Project. 
- The duration of this project is at the discretion of the teacher.  About 4-5 classes are recommended. 
- Project involves conducting research work (survey or interviews) outside of the classroom. 

## Implementation Details

### Complexity and Creativity

   This project is an alternative to the FracCalc and Excel projects in the existing AP Computer Science course. 
   Students should come up with the idea themselves, based on user-centred research, and ideate a calculator application to address the needs of a specific user group.  Students will follow applied design process to implement the idea.  You should talk to your teacher often to ensure that your progress is in-line with expectations. 
   
### Documentation and Style
As with all projects, your program must be well-written, well-documented, and readable.  Writing code with good style is always good idea. This will help you debug, pick up where you left off each day, and keep track of progress.

STEP 1 - UNDERSTANDING CONTEXT

Conduct user-centred research to find design opportunities and barriers.

Select an end-user for whom you will design and create this program (this can be a friend, classmate, relative, etc). Create interview questions that will allow you to understand the end-user’s interests and likes/dislikes.  Since we are creating a cacluator application, here are some possible questions:
  * when was the last time you used a calculator?
  * what do you use it for?  (common uses?)
  
As the interviewee provides answers. They may reply: calculating tips at a restaurant;  or calculating cost of something when travelling in foreign country;   or converting temperature from celcius to farenheit...

At this point, you will need to ask more specific questions: 
  * what function would be helpful?
  * give me an example of some calculation related to [something they mentioned]

STEP 2 - DEFINING AND IDEATING

Choose a design opportunity and point of view, make infereences about limitations and boundaries.  Take creative risks to indentify gaps to explore, generate a range of possibilities, prioritize ideas for prototyping.

Using the responses from your end-user interview, begin to develop a plan for your custom calculator.  Given the duration of the project, you should limit your calculator to do 3 interesting calcuations for the end-user.

List:
   *	the types of calculator functions it will do:
       * what will the user input
       * what output will be calculated
       * have example data for testing
   *	what user interface will the buttons have?
       * a message to prompt for input?
       * a mesage to report on the caluclated output?

Share these ideas with your end user. Record their comments, suggestions and feedback and note any changes that you may make as a result of this interview.

Identify any issues or problems that might arise as you begin to program (what areas might require more information or programming solutions? Where can you find this information?) 

---
*CHECKPOINT 1*

<b> SUBMIT YOUR INTERVIEW QUESTIONS, RESPONSES AND PROGRAM DESIGN PLAN TO YOUR TEACHER. </b>

---

STEP 3 – PROTOTYPING AND TESTING

Construct prototypes, making changes to code as needed.

Program your calculator. Be sure to review course notes and activities to make sure that you effectively implement object oriented programming design for your appliction.

When you are ready, create a short test plan and test your program. Include expected output and actual output and include details related to any fixes that needed to be made.   A good motto to remember is **code a little, test a little**

Have your end-user try a working version of your program. Note their suggestions, comments and feedback. Indicate any changes that you made to the program, based on the user’s feedback.

---
*CHECKPOINT 2*

<b> SUBMIT THE CURRENT VERSION OF YOUR PROGAM TO YOUR TEACHER, AS WELL AS YOUR TEST PLAN AND FEEDBACK FROM THE END-USER </b>

---
  
STEP 4 – SHARING, TESTING AND FINAL ITERATION

Gather feedback from users over time to critically evaluate your design and make changes to product design or processes
Identify new design issues

Share your work with other classmates, friends or family. Record any feedback, suggestions and comments and use this information to make the final iteration of your program.

*CHECKPOINT 3*

<b>SUBMIT THE FINAL VERSION OF YOUR PROGAM TO YOUR TEACHER, AS WELL AS YOUR FEEDBACK FROM CLASSMATES, FRIENDS OR FAMILY.</b>
