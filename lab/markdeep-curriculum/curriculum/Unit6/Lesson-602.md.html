Procedure
---------
Hook your students by prominently displaying art materials, and sample work (of your own making, or
saved from a previous year). To feature the most engaging student examples, look for work that has a
particularly complex or impressive flow-of-control pattern (see WS. 6.2 for explanation). If you
have the time, this would be a great opportunity to display some complex code for students to
examine on their own time. The more intricate the string pattern on the poster, the more intriguing
the sample will appear.

### Bell-work and Attendance \[5 minutes\]

### Introduction & Review of the Project \[10 minutes\]
1. Inheritance makes it convenient to reuse code between classes. However, sometimes we’ll want to
   specialize code in a subclass, or ignore a method that doesn’t apply. Ask students for examples
   when this might be the case. If they’re having trouble thinking of concrete examples, ask them to
   think of an example from their own class hierarchy that they created in the previous lesson. Some
   examples to get the class started:

   - Subclass Mammal might have a special case of Animal superclass method *feedYoung* (because they
     lactate).

   - Subclass *HotDrink* might use a different method chug from the *Drink* superclass (maybe the
     method involves sipping or burning your tongue).

2. Replacing superclass behavior by writing a new version of the methods in the subclass is called
   **overriding**. To override a method, write the method you want to replace in the subclass! No
   special syntax is required!

   - Building on our *Drink* example from the last lesson, we can write our own *chug* method for
     subclass *SugarFreeDrink*:

     ``` Java
     public void chug(double gulp) {
         System.out.println(“Yuck, this tastes terrible!”);
     }
     ```

   - Compare this to the Drink superclass method chug, which is reproduced here for convenience:

     ``` Java
     public void chug (double gulp) {    // Superclass Drink method
         if (ounces < gulp) {
             throw new IllegalArgumentException();
         } else {
             System.out.println("Glug, glug, glug!");
             ounces -=gulp;
             System.out.println("You have " + ounces + "oz. of drink left.");
         }
     }
     ```

3. Have students point out the differences between the two methods, predict the new output, and
   offer additional or alternative changes to the overridden *SugarFreeDrink* *chug* method.

   - Make sure that they (or you) point out that the number of ounces in the drink will NOT be
     updated in the overridden method as it stands.

4. It would be a lot of extra work to re-write the rest of the glug method if all you had wanted to
   do was add an extra println statement that we put in the overridden method. Fortunately, there is a
   way to access that method to put it back into our new, overridden method (highlighted below):

   ``` Java
   public void chug (double gulp) {
       System.out.println("Yuck, this tastes terrible!");
       super.chug(gulp);
   }
   ```

   - This method now outputs “Yuck, this tastes terrible!”, updates the number of ounces to reflect
     the amount you drank, throws an exception if you don’t have any ounces, and outputs the number
     of ounces left in the drink.

   - Ask students why it’s valid to call the overridden method *chug*, and reference the superclass
     method *chug* by the same name. (The superclass method is accessed using dot notation, which
     tells Java where to direct the flow of control.)

5. What if we want to access other information directly from the *Drink* class? Remember, our drink
   class had a fields for *name*, *hasCarbonation*, *gramsOfSugar*, and *ounces*, but they’re all
   private because we were smart and remembered to encapsulate them.

   - If we wanted to write a method in our *SugarFreeDrink* subclass that accesses the data
     contained in *name*, we would have to add a *get* method first in the Superclass *Drink*:

     ``` Java
     public double getName() {    // Written in superclass Drink.
         return name;
     }
     ```

   - This makes a copy of *name* that is public, and can be accessed outside of the *Drink* class.
     Now we can go ahead and write our subclass method using the accessor (highlighted below):

     ``` Java
     public void advertising() {
         System.out.println (
             "Avoid the extra calories by drinking delicious " + getName() + "every day!!"
         );
     }
     ```

6. Have students offer additional examples using the *Drink* superclass, or using examples from
   their own class hierarchy.

7. Complete the introduction by asking students to explain what the difference is between overriding
   and overloading methods. (Overloading methods is when one class contains multiple methods with
   the same name, but a different number of parameters—sometimes called the *parameter signature*.)

### Student Work \[15 minutes\]
1. Briefly review WS 6.2 with your students, reading the directions aloud if need be.

2. If you haven’t already distributed project materials at this point, do so while your students are
   rearranging into partner pairs.

3. Encourage students to take 5 – 10 minutes on Step 1. They should review all steps of the project
   to ensure that their additional methods make sense.

   Announce that you’ll offer extra credit to funny or creative code (if that fits in with your
   teaching style).

4. Offer time checks so students can stay on pace. Before you allow students to begin the peer
   review tour of others’ work, remind them to take notes on their feedback so they will be able to
   contribute to the group critique/discussion at the end of class.

### Peer Review \[10 minutes\]
Allow students 10 minutes to tour each other’s work and offer feedback.

### Whole-group Discussion/Critique \[10 minutes\]
If possible, rearrange student seats into a circle for the critique to encourage informal
discussion.

- As a whole group, ask students to volunteer what they really liked about others’ projects.

- Solicit questions and critiques, and re-teach if needed.

- Award classroom participation points to all students who contribute to the discussion.


Accommodation and Differentiation
---------------------------------
Encourage advanced students to add additional classes, fields, methods, and client code. If students
still have time to spare, encourage them to increase code complexity, add additional levels to the
class hierarchy, or help their peers.

If you have a few students that are struggling with the assignment, allow them to work in groups of
4, each pair helping the other with their code. If students need additional guidance, have students
complete the worksheet as a series of think-pair-shares, where you return to whole group to share
and discuss answers before moving on to the next step. **Teaching the class this way will roughly
double the time required to complete the exercise.**


Misconceptions
--------------
When first learning polymorphism, students learn method override before method overload. However, in
order to successfully override a method, the subclass method must have the same method signature as
the superclass, otherwise the method will be overloaded. The code must match the method parameters
and return type and the methods public, they cannot be private or static. When helping students
debug their code where the overridden method is not behaving as anticipated, asking the student if
the method signatures match can help find the error on their own.
