Materials & Prep
----------------
- **Projector and computer** with this page: <http://www.legendarypokemon.net/javacalc.html>
- **Whiteboard and** **markers**
- **Classroom copies** of [WS 4.4]
- **Instructor copy** of WS 4.4 Answer

The “worksheet” for today is a 5-page work packet, so if your school has long lines/production time
for the copy machine, plan ahead!


Pacing Guide
------------
| Section                               | Total Time |
|---------------------------------------|-----------:|
| Bell-work and attendance              |       5min |
| Student activity                      |   25–30min |
| Student trade & check                 |       5min |
| Whole group review & paper submission |      15min |


Procedure
---------
Hook your class today with the concept of a “backwards” class structure. Using only the information
gleaned from last night’s reading (and perhaps some help from a friend), students should work
through as much of the worksheet as they can in the time allotted (~30 minutes). Finish the class
with whole-class note taking on the topics that were challenging in the sheet.

### Bell-work and Attendance \[5 minutes\]

### Student Activity \[25-30 minutes\]
Have students start working on WS 4.4 in pairs or alone. Use a timer to help students pace
themselves.

### Students Trade & Check \[5 minutes\]
After 25–30 minutes give students a few minutes to check each others’ work.

### Whole Group Review & Paper Submission
1. As a whole group, ask students for questions they had on the worksheet. Use the answer key
   included on this to guide instruction.

2. Collect worksheets at the end of class.


Accommodation and Differentiation
---------------------------------

If you have been using Parson Problems throughout the year, your students will be familiar with the
format of Question 8 on the worksheet. For other classes, this may be the first time they’ve been
asked to rearrange provided code. Read through the problem out loud with the class, then read
through the lines of code in the bottom half of the question. Each line of code (even the lone
bracket) can be shuffled and re-arranged to provide the correct code sequence.

Student success in this lesson relies heavily on students’ having been able to read and comprehend
the prior nights’ reading. In ELL classrooms, encourage students to open their books and work with
the text in front of them, and pair students of differing language abilities.

- If you know your students’ reading abilities will not allow for a lesson like this, conduct the
  lesson as a whole-group, teaching a segment of the chapter and pausing to let students work on a
  question before moving forward.

- The worksheet matches up sequentially with section 7.3, so you can have students read along with
  your in the book as you work through the sheet, and/or you can allow advanced students to work on
  their own as you help the rest of class.

There will probably be a lot of variation in how long it takes students to complete today’s
assignment.

- Ask students who finish early to design a hands-on demonstration that uses the array whiteboards
  (and any other materials around the room) to explain the proper answers to the questions on the
  worksheet. If they come up with any cool demos, use them during student review at the end of the
  class.

- Be ready with a Pokemon Challenge for the students that speed through the assignment:

### POKEMON CHALLENGE

This java based calculator (http://www.legendarypokemon.net/javacalc.html) uses median IVs (initial
values) and input EVs (effort values) to calculate a Pokemon’s stats on a given level.

Write a method called medianIV that accepts an array of integer IVs as its parameter and returns the
median of the numbers in the array.

The median number is the number that appears in the middle of the list if you arrange the elements
in order. You can assume that the array is of odd size (so that one element is found in the middle),
and that the numbers in the array are between 0 and 99, inclusive. For example, the median of `[5,
9, 4, 10, 11]` is 9, and the median of `[0, 8, 1, 89, 48, 27, 30]` is 27.

_Hint: Check out the Tally program in chapter 7 for some ideas on what code to use._
