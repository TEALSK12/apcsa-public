Materials & Prep
----------------
- **Projector and computer**
- **Whiteboard and** **markers**
- **Classroom copies** of [WS 3.16] (RPS, Pig), [DeMorgan’s Law], [Poster 3.16.1], [Poster 3.16.2]
- **Link** to rock-paper-scissor game (<http://tinyurl.com/bubyvtu>)

Truth tables are an important tool, especially for some AP test questions. If you are not familiar
with truth tables, watch this 5 minute tutorial online (<http://tinyurl.com/mw8ohof>). We recommend
instructors draw out the &&, ||, and ! truth tables, and maybe do an intermediate example of a
two-operator expression, before getting into the De Morgan’s law example later in class.

Procedure
---------
In place of bell-work, invite students to warm up for class by visiting the online Rock Paper
Scissor game at the link above. After a quick review of Boolean logic and variables, students will
be asked to build their own Rock Paper Scissor game. This programming project should take between 2
and 3 55-minute class periods to complete

### Attendance & Student Play \[5 minutes\]

### Introduction to Boolean Logic \[10 minutes\]

1. Students should have already reviewed this material as part of last nights’ homework assignment.
   Before moving on to purely mathematical examples, start with a real-life example of how we apply
   logic. Be sure to change P and Q to statements that are relevant to your students.

     - P: It is a holiday.<br>
       Q: My family is having dinner together.

       !(p || q) ⇒ It is not the case that (it is a holiday OR my family is having dinner together)

       !p && !q ⇒ It is not a holiday AND my family is not having dinner together.

     - Review `&&`, `||`, and `!`, including non-examples:

       ```
       ┌──────────┬───────────────────────┬────────────────────┐
       │ Operator │       Expression      │ Result             │
       ┝━━━━━━━━━━┿━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┿━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┥
       │   AND    │  (4 == 4) && (2 > 1)  │ Evaluates to: True │
       │   OR     │  (1 < 2) ││ (2 < 1)   │ Evaluates to: True │
       │   NOT    │  !(2 < 1)             │ Evaluates to: True │
       └──────────┴───────────────────────┴────────────────────┘
       ```

       ``` Java
       if (q == 1 || 2 || 4) {     // ERROR: You must use full Boolean expressions.
          statement;
          statement;
       }
       ```

       ``` Java
       if (q == 1 || q == 2 || q == 4) {      // Correct
          statement;
          statement;
       }
       ```

2. As a special note on negating Boolean expressions, review De Morgan’s law (poster 3.16.1). Have
   students write De Morgan’s law on their Tricky Code Cheat Sheet.

   - If you feel confident working with truth tables, work through the following illustration of De
     Morgan’s laws. On the board or projector, only write table headers as you go (putting them all
     up at once may lead to panic/distraction for some students).

     ```
           p           q         p ││ q    !(p ││ q)      !p           !q      !p && !q
     ┌───────────┬───────────┬───────────┬───────────┬───────────┬───────────┬───────────┐
     │     F     │     F     │           │           │           │           │           │
     │     F     │     T     │           │           │           │           │           │
     │     T     │     F     │           │           │           │           │           │
     │     T     │     T     │           │           │           │           │           │
     └───────────┴───────────┴───────────┴───────────┴───────────┴───────────┴───────────┘
     ```

     Have students help you fill out every possible combination of Boolean values for p and q.

   - Ask students to evaluate the logical expression for each value of p and q.

     ```
           p           q         p ││ q    !(p ││ q)      !p           !q      !p && !q
     ┌───────────┬───────────┬───────────┬───────────┬───────────┬───────────┬───────────┐
     │     F     │     F     │     F     │           │           │           │           │
     │     F     │     T     │     T     │           │           │           │           │
     │     T     │     F     │     T     │           │           │           │           │
     │     T     │     T     │     T     │           │           │           │           │
     └───────────┴───────────┴───────────┴───────────┴───────────┴───────────┴───────────┘
     ```

   - Now have students negate all of the values from the previous column.

     ```
           p           q         p ││ q    !(p ││ q)      !p           !q      !p && !q
     ┌───────────┬───────────┬───────────┬───────────┬───────────┬───────────┬───────────┐
     │           │           │     F     │     T     │           │           │           │
     │           │           │     T     │     F     │           │           │           │
     │           │           │     T     │     F     │           │           │           │
     │           │           │     T     │     F     │           │           │           │
     └───────────┴───────────┴───────────┴───────────┴───────────┴───────────┴───────────┘
     ```

   - Ask students to complete the values for !p and !q, referring to the values from the first
     column.

     ```
           p           q         p ││ q    !(p ││ q)      !p           !q      !p && !q
     ┌───────────┬───────────┬───────────┬───────────┬───────────┬───────────┬───────────┐
     │     F     │     F     │           │           │    T      │     T     │           │
     │     F     │     T     │           │           │    T      │     F     │           │
     │     T     │     F     │           │           │    F      │     T     │           │
     │     T     │     T     │           │           │    F      │     F     │           │
     └───────────┴───────────┴───────────┴───────────┴───────────┴───────────┴───────────┘
     ```

   - Now have students apply the && operator to !p and !q.

     ```
           p           q         p ││ q    !(p ││ q)      !p           !q      !p && !q
     ┌───────────┬───────────┬───────────┬───────────┬───────────┬───────────┬───────────┐
     │           │           │           │           │    T      │     T     │    T      │
     │           │           │           │           │    T      │     F     │    F      │
     │           │           │           │           │    F      │     T     │    F      │
     │           │           │           │           │    F      │     F     │    F      │
     └───────────┴───────────┴───────────┴───────────┴───────────┴───────────┴───────────┘
     ```

   - Point out to your students that these two columns are the same. Whenever two columns of a truth
     table are the same, we say that the expressions (column headings) are equivalent, or
     interchangeable.

     ```
           p           q         p ││ q    !(p ││ q)      !p           !q      !p && !q
     ┌───────────┬───────────┬───────────┬───────────┬───────────┬───────────┬───────────┐
     │           │           │           │     T     │           │           │    T      │
     │           │           │           │     F     │           │           │    F      │
     │           │           │           │     F     │           │           │    F      │
     │           │           │           │     F     │           │           │    F      │
     └───────────┴───────────┴───────────┴───────────┴───────────┴───────────┴───────────┘
     ```

   In the illustration above, we showed that `!(p && q)` is equivalent to `!p && !q`. Invite
   students to show the equivalence of `!(p && q)` and `!p || !q`.

3. Review operator precedence on your classroom poster 3.16.2 (or projected overhead, if you’re
   having a student make the poster for you during class).

4. Check for student understanding by having students complete Practice-It self-check questions
   assertions1 and assertions3.

### Student Programming Activity \[40 minutes\]
On the projector, board or as a handout (WS 3.16), give students the following programming prompt. A
link to the NY Times article about rock paper scissors is included in the Materials section of this
lesson plan.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### PROGRAMMING ACTIVITY

##### Exercise 1
Write a game that plays many rounds of Rock Paper Scissors. The user and computer will each choose
between three items: rock (defeats scissors, but loses to paper), paper (defeats rock, but loses to
scissors), and scissors (defeats paper, but loses to rock). If the player and computer choose the
same item, the game is a tie.

- A good program will prompt for user input, compare input to a computer counter-move, then output a
  verdict (user loses, wins, or ties), prompt for another round or exit.

- An excellent program will do all that a satisfactory program does, but will use different
  algorithmic strategies for choosing the best item. Teacher’s note: there is no superior
  strategy—the focus here is to get students to try different approaches and conclude that on their
  own.

##### Exercise 2
You and your partner should test out the game by playing it at least 3 times each. Keep record of
how many moves it took before you won or lost the game.

##### Exercise 3
Write a program that compares 2 players. Your program should prompt for each player (1) the number
of times they played the game, (2) the number of times they won the game, (3) the number of moves
for each game. Have the program report which player performs better on the basis of their reported
statistics. Test your program by inputting your and your partner’s results from Exercise 2.

##### Exercise 4
Write a program that plays the dice game Pig. Pig is a 2-player game where the players take turns
repeatedly rolling a single 6-sided die. A player repeatedly rolls the die until one of the two
events occurs: (1) either the player chooses to stop rolling, in which case the sum of that player’s
rolls are added to his/her total points, or (2) if the player rolls a 1 at any time, all points from
that turn are lots and the turn ends immediately. The first player to reach a score of at least 100
points wins.

**To get full credit on this assignment, you must include a structure diagram and/or pseudocode
  explaining your strategy.**

_Before you begin, take a moment to decide how your computer will pick rock, paper, or scissor.
Should the computer pick randomly? Should it pick the same item always? Should it repeat the same
item for a time, then switch strategies? Read through the New York Times article on Rock Paper
Scissor, and any other online sources you choose to help you draft a plan for your program._

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Allow students to work in pairs, and encourage pairs to test out each others’ programs, look at
  each others code (to check for errors), etc. If students appear to be working too closely, remind
  them that each team is responsible for writing their own code.

- Start grading student note-books in small batches (so students are not without their notebooks for
  too long!)


Accommodation and Differentiation
---------------------------------
Invite your artistic students to create posters 3.16.1 and 3.16.2 for your classroom. If needed,
work through the 2 Practice-It questions as a whole class.

For your more advanced students, you might encourage them to create more complex algorithms, or more
advanced interaction with the user. If they are interested in AI and machine learning, invite them
to research the topic and experiment with different techniques on their Rock Paper Scissor program.


Misconceptions
--------------
- Students often have the misconception that logical OR (`||`) is exclusive OR. In a student’s daily
  life, they can have either brownie or the cupcake. This implies they can have one or the other,
  not both. However, in boolean logic, “a or b” is also true if _both_ are true.

- Students ask why the symbol `&&` for AND an `||` for OR? And why double `&&` vs single `&`.

  Java was derived from the C programming language. The designers Kernighan and Richie made design
  decisions based on prior programming languages of their time. The history of C can be found here:
  <https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/chist.html>. Java’s use of `&` and `|` is historically
  based on C.

- A common syntax error by beginner and experienced programmers alike is typing a single ampersand
  `&` or vertical bar `|`. Single `&` and `|` are _bitwise_ operators, and are not the same as
  double `&&` and `||` which are logical AND and OR, respectively.

- Logical operators AND and OR do not follow English language syntax. For example, testing whether a
  dice roll is either 7 or 11 could be translated incorrectly to:

  ``` Java
  if (roll == 7 || 11)           // INCORRECT: Logical operator misconception
  if (roll == 7 || roll == 11)   // CORRECT
  ```
