====================================================================================================

Overview
--------
### Objectives — _Students will be able to…_
- **Identify** weaknesses in their Unit 1 knowledge.

### Assessments — _Students will…_
- **Create** a personalized list of review topics to guide tonight’s study session.

### Homework — _Students will…_
- **Study** for tomorrow’s test!


Materials & Prep
----------------
- **Projector and computer**
- **Whiteboard and marker**
- **Results** from electronic survey of review topics
- **Classroom copies** of the practice test [WS 1.9]

Once students have submitted their review requests, assemble those topics into categories and
prepare to re-teach the topics as needed.

Procedure
---------

Engage the class in the review session by pointing out that your review topics have been hand
selected by the class. Explain that you will review test-taking strategies in addition to reviewing
subject matter.

### Bell-work and Attendance [5 minutes]

### Introduction and Test Format Orientation [15 minutes]

1. Clearly indicate that you expect all students to have a list of review topics to study this
  evening. Periodically remind students that this list will be checked at the end of class.

2. Begin by explaining the portions of the mock-test. Read aloud the instructions on each page, and
  explain the strange layout (the test is designed to look like the AP exam, and contains all of the
  directions on the exam so students will not have to waste time understanding them in May).

3. Solve the sample problems on the test as a whole group, encouraging students to give you the
  answers whenever possible. Answer any questions that students bring up as you go.

### Test Review [30 minutes]

1. Using the results from the electronic survey, address the various review topics, prioritizing
  questions that popped up the most.
  1. Some questions you may already have addressed while working through the sample test.
  2. Be ready for additional questions to pop up as you go. Save yourself the work and use old
     homework questions and student-generated test questions as examples to work through.
  3. Jot down notes about which topics you covered in review so you can adjust the exam to reflect
     the topics your students have learned.

2. Use a combination of group-solving questions on the whiteboard, think-pair-share, and
  timed-response as review strategies.

3. After you’ve completed reviewing an idea, remind the class that they should write down that topic
  if they feel they still have to review it tonight. (Yes, this will be a reminder every few
  minutes, but it will pay off later when students start creating review lists without prompting
  later in the year!)

### Check student study lists [5 minutes]
Spend the last 5 minutes of class checking each student’s review topic list.


Accommodation and Differentiation
---------------------------------
In ELL classes, you may want to change code-writing questions to Parsons Problems. Educational
research shows a high correlation between Parsons scores and code writing scores, and a low
correlation between code writing and tracing and between Parsons and tracing. (In other words,
Parsons Problems accurately assess a students’ ability to create code.) For more information on
Parsons Problems, check out [_Evaluating a New Exam Question: Parsons
Problems_](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/fa08/cse599/denny.pdf).

Even in a non-ELL class, you may want to change some Section II questions to Parsons problems
because (1) grading the questions is easier, since logic and syntax errors are easy to discern, and
(2) students challenged by language processing are able to more quickly complete the problem.
