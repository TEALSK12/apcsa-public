## Curriculum Issues

TEALS will only continue making small corrections and critical updates to TEALS curricula. Please <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue">open an issue</a> if you encounter things like factual, spelling, or grammatical errors, broken links, sequencing problems (topics needed before they are taught), or incomplete/missing materials.
