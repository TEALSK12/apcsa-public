Procedure
---------
All guides, sample code, answer code, and example code may be found by logging into the College Board AP Audit side and downloading the Consumer Review Lab materials.


### General Project Notes
- Open Eclipse and guide students through opening the Consumer Review files.

- Encourage students to use their Tricky Code Cheat Sheets, 4 Commandments of Scope, notebooks,
  textbooks, classroom posters, and homework assignments.

- Offer occasional time-checks to help keep students on pace.

- Grade notebooks and review books in between helping students so students can keep notebooks for
  homework and studying in the evenings.


Accommodation and Differentiation
---------------------------------
In ELL classrooms, read all directions aloud before breaking into individual practice, and allow up
to twice the amount of time for completion of the lab. As needed, allow students to pair up to help
each other with reading comprehension (but remind students that they each must submit their own
code). Each day that you begin the lab, start with a quick survey of student concerns and questions.
