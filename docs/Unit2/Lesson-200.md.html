Pacing Guide
------------
| Section                              | Total Time |
|--------------------------------------|-----------:|
| Bell-work and attendance             |       5min |
| Class discussion (if needed)         |      10min |
| Test review and reteach              |      30min |
| Check student notes and return tests |       5min |


Procedure
---------
Return student grades before class begins or while students are completing the bellwork.

Do not return students’ tests before the review session, since you want to motivate students to pay
attention to the entire review, taking supplemental notes the entire time.

### Bell-work and Attendance \[5 minutes\]

### Class Discussion (if needed) \[10 minutes\]

1. If grades are low, invite the class to a discussion of what can be improved. Begin with student
   complaints and suggestions to build student buy-in. Ask students:
   - How they felt they were going to do before the test
   - What surprised them once they were taking the test
   - What they felt worked in the first unit (lessons, review strategies, assignments)
   - What do they think they want to change for the second unit

2. Once you feel that a dialogue has been established, validate students’ feelings, then challenge
   them (_e.g._ AP courses are stressful, but this is good practice for college, where the pace is
   faster and professors don’t give personalized instruction). In a non-judgmental, supportive tone,
   remind students that to be successful in the course:
   - Reading is mandatory

   - Homework is mandatory (And valuable! You will never assign “busy” work.)

   - To better manage their time, students should plan for 1 hour of homework a weeknight, with up to
     2 hours of homework each weekend. If this seems impossible, they should meet with you or their
     guidance counselor to assess whether they can fit in an AP class at this time.

   - It is VERY important to keep your tone sympathetic at this point—an overworked, overstressed,
     underperforming student will slow your entire class down, and color that student against CS for
     the future!

### Test Review and Reteach \[30 minutes\]

1. Walk the students through each question on the test, glossing over questions that everyone
   answered correctly.

   a. You can ask for students to volunteer answers, or call on students randomly. Make sure that
   students explain their logic when they answer. If a student gives an incorrect answer, the
   explanation will tell you what you need to re-teach or clarify.

   b. Do not skip questions that everyone answered correctly, but do not spend more than the time it
   takes to read the question, and congratulate students’ correct answers.

2. Project a copy of each question as you review—this will help students recall the question/process
   the information.

3. Make sure that students are taking notes during the re-teach, reminding students that for
   homework, they will have an opportunity to win back some of the points on their exam.

4. For Section II questions, select a sample of student work (with any identifying information
   obscured), and work through the answer together as a class.

### Check student notes and return tests \[5 minutes\]
At the end of class, check student notes, and return the tests in hard copy form if applicable.


Accommodation and Differentiation
---------------------------------
The curriculum does not officially cover the char type since it is not included in the AP subset.
However, if your class is progressing quickly, feel free into introduce char into all future
examples, worksheets, and tests.

In ELL classrooms, you should give more examples for each type, and spend more time drilling during
the introduction and note-taking segments.
